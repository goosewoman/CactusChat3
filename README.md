# Minecraft Java Edition Chat Client

I didn't sign any code cuz I'm a web developer and don't have any certificates lying around.

## How to run: 
### Linux: 
- Make AppImage executable.
- Double click.
### Mac OS
- Right click the DMG
- Click open (double clicking doesn't work cuz no code signing)
### Windows
- Double Click the EXE.
- Ignore the warnings
- It's now in your start menu as an installed program.
